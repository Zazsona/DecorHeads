#This is the heads file for defining heads used in the plugin, and where you can add your own!
#All heads require a unique key, name, and texture:
#  Key: Name to identify the head, must not match other heads and cannot contain spaces.
#  Name: The name of the head seen in-game, can match other heads and contain spaces
#  Texture: Base64 encoded skin URL (same as when using /give)
#An example is available below:

#steve:
#  name: Steve's Head
#  texture: e3RleHR1cmVzOntTS0lOOnt1cmw6Imh0dHA6Ly90ZXh0dXJlcy5taW5lY3JhZnQubmV0L3RleHR1cmUvOWY5NTRlOTNmZTE2NDBmNDdlOTE2YzI2NjIyZWFjZjkyZmQ0NTg2MzcxZjVmMDdmZDlhN2RkZWRhZjQifX19

#Further tags can be used to set how the head spawns:
#------- Blocks -------
# drop-blocks (Sets blocks the head can drop from, recognised by their IDs used in /give - leave empty for all blocks)
#  Example: drop-blocks: ['dirt', 'oak_log']
# drop-blocks-tools (Sets tools that can be used to get a head from drop blocks, can be any item or block - leave empty for all tools)
#  Example: drop-blocks-tools: ['diamond_axe', 'gravel']
