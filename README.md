Ever found some beer with your brewing? A small branch when chopping a log? Or a chunk of redstone from some ore? How about popping someone's head off in PvP?



DecorHeads is a survival-oriented head plugin that introduces over one-hundred decorative head blocks into Minecraft in a natural way, by having them drop from blocks, mobs, players, and more. Some heads can even be crafted through new recipes!


All heads can be fully customised, through how they drop, drop rates, and crafting mechanics. You can even add your own custom heads to expand your world however you like! The Wiki has guides on how to get started and all the options available.

On top of the heads, DecorHeads supports configuration of plugin behaviour through in-game commands as well as the config files, and offers a range of permissions:
